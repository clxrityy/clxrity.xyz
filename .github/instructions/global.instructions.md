# Global Instructions

These instructions apply to all files in the repository. If there are conflicting instructions in a file or directory-specific instruction set, the file-specific instructions take precedence.

## General Guidelines

- Ensure code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices.
  - Reduce cognitive load by breaking down complex functions into smaller, manageable pieces.
  - Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance readability.
  - Strcture code logically, grouping and nesting related functionalities together.
- Maintain consistency in coding style, including indentation, spacing, and naming conventions.
- Include comments where necessary to explain complex logic or decisions.
- Ensure proper error handling and validation to enhance robustness.
- Optimize for performance where applicable, avoiding unnecessary computations or memory usage.
- Adhere to security best practices, especially when handling sensitive data or user inputs.
- End every change with a brief commit message suggestion summarizing the modifications made.

## Negative Instructions

- Do not introduce any new dependencies or libraries without explicit approval.
- Avoid using deprecated or outdated functions, methods, or libraries.
- Do not make changes that could introduce breaking changes to existing functionality unless explicitly requested.
- Do not remove or alter existing comments unless they are incorrect or misleading.
- Do not make changes that could negatively impact performance or security.

See the file-specific instructions for any additional guidelines or exceptions that may apply to particular files or directories.
